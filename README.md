# Enviro-mini
Hey, thanks for checking out my project!

Feel free to modify as you wish, the design was done on easyeda so I am not sure how well the altium schematic will work.

You'll find a BOM along with gerber files and the arduino sketch, everything you need to make the project yourself.

Some tips for programming:
- Progamming can only be done using ISP
- The ISP header is arudino standard 
- I found MCUDude minicore was the best way to program the mcu
- Make sure you burn the bootloader to set the fuses otherwise it will work using a 1MHz clock and do some weird things
